## Frontend theme for [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

I was inspired by ['robbyrussell'](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#robbyrussell) and ['af-magic'](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#af-magic) themes and I also added a display version of node.js

### Requiremets

1. MacOS
2. [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)

### Install

1. Move the file `gorchak.zsh-theme` to `.oh-my-zsh/themes` folder
2. `omz theme set gorchak`
